This assignment I was able to understand well what you wanted.. Looking at the specific methods I see that there are easier/cleaner ways I could have gone about doing the assignment but overall I did well.. For example, the public static void reverseArray(int[] arr, int left, int right) method we approached in a similar way and I was able to test my code in a main method to make sure that ot worked properly. It is methods like those  that I feel are asier for me to grasp as I was rearranign numbers to make sure they follow the specific rules. The public static int countOccurrences method lokking at yours I see that there's a simple way to going about methods such as this one. Binary search was the most difficult for me but was able to get to work properly and looking at your code for it definetly helps in seeing what I could have done better.
